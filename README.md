So we can say : 
***
people with a fixed mindset believe that abilities are inborn , it means they are unchangeable . But people with growth mindset believe that abilities can be developed.

### How can we develop our growth mindset :
1. Challenges and Effort: don't say you can't do it , try more and more to develop your skills until you can do. 
2. Obstacles : don't give up and defince all the things that push you down  
4. Criticism : Accept all the one who critisize you as giving you some advice. 
5. Success of others : learn  from others success
