# Welcome to my website
I am Tasnim Al Wheebi. I had graduated from Al Yarmouk University since 2012 specialized in English language and literatures. I have almost seven years experience working as a  teacher. I like playing on accordion in free time and I am a beginner learning playing on violin. I love travelling and I hope to go on a trip round the world one day.
