# **OBJECT**
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

**IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME
KNOWN AS PROPERTIES.FUNCTIONS BECOME
KNOWN AS METHODS.**

**Object contains :**
* properties : 
    * VALUE : The value of a property can be a
st ring, number, Boolean, array, or
even another object.
    * KEY 
* methods : function

 **Programmers use a lot of name/value pairs:**
 * HTML uses attribute names and values.
* CSS uses property names and values.
* In JavaScript:
    * Variables have a name and you can assign them a
value of a string, number, or Boolean.
    * Arrays have a name and a group of values.
    * Named functions have a name and value.
    * Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs.


##  Document Object Model (DOM)
The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.
It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:
* MAKING A MODEL OF THE
HTML PAGE :The DOM specifies the way in which the
browser should structure this model using
a DOM tree.
The DOM is called an object model
because the model (the DOM tree) is
made of objects.
* ACCESSING AND CHANGING
THE HTML PAGE :
he DOM states what
your script can "ask the browser about the
current page, and how to tell the browser
to update 
THE DOM TREE IS A
MODEL OF A WEB PAGE  :
It consists of four main types of nodes.
* BODY OF HTML PAGE
