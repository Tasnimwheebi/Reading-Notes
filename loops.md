# COMPERSSSION & OPERATORS 
* There are two types of operators :

1. compression  operator. 

2. logical operator.

## COMPARISON OPERATORS
 you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean : true or false .
 

 COMPARISON OPERATORS SYMBOLES :
| compression symbols| uses for |
| :---:| :---:|
| ==	|its equal to |
|!=	|its not equal to |
|=== |	the script is equal to | 
|!== |	the script is not equal to |
|> |	grater than | 
|< |	less than |
|>= |	grater than or equal to |
|<= |	less than or equal to |
 

## LOGICAL OPERATORS :
1.AND &&: it tests more than one condition . The  both expressions must evaluate to true.

2.OR II: it test at least one condition . just one expression  must be evaluate to true

3.NOT !: it takes a single boolean value and inverts  it.

example :

!(5<6)  

it will return false .

 

# LOOPS
 Loops check a condition, If it returns true, a code block will run.Then the condition will be checked again and If it still return true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition return false .
 (Links to an external site.)There are 3 types of loop :
* for 
* while
* do while
