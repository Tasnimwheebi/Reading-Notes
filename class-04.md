## **LINKS**
### WRITNG LINKS :
Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.We can also link lists.and link more than one page to the same site.
### Relative Link Type:
* Same Folder :
To link to a file in the same folder, just use the file
name. 
+ Child Folder :
For a child folder, use the name of the child folder,
followed by a forward slash, then the file name.
* Grandchild Folder :
Use the name of the child folder, followed by a
forward slash, then the name of the grandchild
folder, followed by another forward slash, then the
file name.
* Parent Folder :
Use ../ to indicate the folder above the current one,
then follow it with the file name.
* GrandParent Folder :
Repeat the ../ to indicate that you want to go up
two folders (rather than one), then follow it with the
file name.
***
* **mailto:** To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address.
* **target**
If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
`<a>` tag.
* **link spesific part to same page** At the top of a long page
you might want to add a list
of contents that links to the
corresponding sections lower
down. Or you might want to add
a link from part way down the
page back to the top of it to save
users from having to scroll back
to the top.

## **LAYOUT**
### Positioning Elements:
* Building Blocks :CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.
* Containing Elements :If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

### positioning schemes :
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning.

## **Functions, Methods, and Objects**
### **FUNCTION**
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task.you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
* When you ask the function to perform its task, it is known as ***calling*** the function.
* Pieces of information passed to a function are known as ***parameters.***
* When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a ***return value.***

### **DECLARING FUNCTION**
1. You declare the function using the function keyword.
2. You give the function name.
3. The statment that perform the tasks sit in a code block.
