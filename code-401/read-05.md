# Linked Lists
**A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.**
#### Advantages
- Linked list can expand in constant time.
- Linked is a dynamic data structure.
- Insertion and deletion operations are easier.
- Efficient memory utilization.

#### DisAdvantages
- The memory is wasted as pointers require extra memory for storage.
- No element can be accessed randomly, it has to access each node sequentially i.e. proper traversal must be done.
- Reverse Traversing is difficult in the linked list(though we can achieve this with the help of Doubly Linked List).

## data structures
 which are the different ways that we can organize our data; variables, arrays, hashes, and objects are all types of data structures.
## Linear data structures

linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. We can think of a linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially. Linear structures, however, are the opposite of non-linear structures. In non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

## Memory management
The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines.

* When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory.
* On the other hand, when a linked list is born, it doesn’t need the amount of memory all in one place.

**NOTE :** The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures.


## Lists for all shapes and sizes
* **Singly linked lists**
* **doubly linked list**
* **A circular linked list**
