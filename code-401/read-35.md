## Google AI Principles
AI is computer programming that learns and adapts. It can’t solve every problem, but its potential to improve our lives is profound. At Google, we use AI to make products more useful—from email that’s spam-free and easier to compose, to a digital assistant you can speak to naturally, to photos that pop the fun stuff out for you to enjoy.
### AI should:
1.  Be socially beneficial. 

The expanded reach of new technologies increasingly touches society as a whole. Advances in AI will have transformative impacts in a wide range of fields, including healthcare, security, energy, transportation, manufacturing, and entertainment.
2. Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.

AI algorithms and datasets can reflect, reinforce, or reduce unfair biases.  
3. Be built and tested for safety.
4. Be accountable to people.

5. Incorporate privacy design principles.

6. Uphold high standards of scientific excellence.

7. Be made available for uses that accord with these principles.  

### Goals of AI

To Create Expert Systems − The systems which exhibit intelligent behavior, learn, demonstrate, explain, and advice its users. To Implement Human Intelligence in Machines − Creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans.

### Types of AI:

1. Reactive Machines
2. Limited Memory
3. Theory of Mind
4. Self-awareness
