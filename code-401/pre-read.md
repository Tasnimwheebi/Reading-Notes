# Solving Problems
###  A simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem:
1. **Read the problem completely twice:**

If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it. 

2. **Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data:**

It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely. It’s very important that when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.  You may need to write out all the things you are normally storing in your head. 


3. **Optimize the manual steps:**


 It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code. Try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state. Figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

3. **Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code:**

Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution. Capture all the steps  and either put them into  editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

2. **Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code:**

 If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all. Now  take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.
 If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

* You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps and you can solve it by try going back to the second step and being as meticulous as possible.  Write out each and every single step.


* You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

 Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:
 * Create a list
* Sort a list or array
* Create a map or dictionary
* Loop through a list, or dictionary
* Parse strings
* Convert from string to int, int to string, etc
3. **Optimize the real code:**

it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.
And all your variables are named with long meaningful names. Having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake!

# How to think like a programmer
Problem solving is the meta-skill.
Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.
Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.

##  Have a framework
If you start with principles we all agree are good, you’ll get a lot further a lot quicker.

So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

Here are the steps:
1. **Understand :**

Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them. You should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it . “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman.

2. **Plan:**

Don’t dive right into solving without a plan. Plan your solution!
Write down the exact steps. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. **Divide:**

If you have a big problem ,break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots. Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.

4. **Stuck?**

three things to try when facing a stuck:

* Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
* Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.
* Sidenote:Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
* Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems.  Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

# 5 Whys Problem Solving skills 
## Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

Stubborn or recurrent problems are often symptoms of deeper issues. "Quick fixes" may seem convenient, but they often solve only the surface issues and waste resources that could otherwise be used to tackle the real cause.

## When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis
It may not be suitable if you need to tackle a complex or critical problem. This is because 5 Whys can lead you to pursue a single track, or a limited number of tracks, of inquiry when, in fact, there could be multiple causes. In cases like these, a wider-ranging method such as Cause and Effect Analysis  or Failure Mode and Effects Analysis  may be more effective. This simple technique, however, can often direct you quickly to the root cause of a problem.

## How to Use the 5 Whys
The model follows a very simple seven-step process: 

1. Assemble a Team.
2. Define the Problem.
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times.
5. Know When to Stop.
6. Address the Root Cause(s).
7. Monitor Your Measures
