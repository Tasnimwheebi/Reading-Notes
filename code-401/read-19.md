# Component Based UI
**React.js** is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It’s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React first deployed on Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.
 
React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

## Why JSX?
React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
* Specifying Attributes with JSX :
You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes.
* Specifying Children with JSX:
If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML.
* JSX Prevents Injection Attacks :
It is safe to embed user input in JSX.
* JSX Represents Objects :
Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.


**Rendering Elements**

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. An element describes what you want to see on the screen.

    * Backbone
    * Node
    * Ember
    * Meteor

* **What’s the difference between a framework and a library?**

The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## **Term**
* **Rendering**

Javascript uses the document object model (DOM) to manipulate the DOM elements. Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser. The DOM establishes parent-child relationships, and adjacent sibling relationships, among the various elements in the HTML file.

* **Templates**

Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side templates with Javascript using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, peppered with tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
