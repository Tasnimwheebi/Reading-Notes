# Trees
A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

* **Depth First**
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root

The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion. With these traversals, we rely on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when we have reached the end of a sub-path.

* **Breadth First**
Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree.

 

## K-ary Trees
A tree with no more than k children for each node. In an array implementation for a tree without insertions, nodes might be overlapped in one big array, since many entries are note used.  Such an improvement is also referred to as "packed" or "compressed".

 

## Binary Search Trees
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
