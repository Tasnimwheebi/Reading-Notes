# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Cloud Computing
cloud enables users to get their applications to market quickly. Data security: Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups. Savings on equipment: Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment.

## AWS
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.


## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. **Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle**
The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

2. **Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC**

All resources are hosted on a server. The server’s location on the web can be identified by its IP address, however, IP addresses aren’t particularly user friendly, and instead we use URLS (such as http://www.google.co.uk) to search for a resource.
Once the client’s request has reached the server, the server will search for and return the information the client is requesting. Often times, this means querying a database, loading the information into an html page, and returning the HTML text to the user in the body of the HTTP response.

3. **What does it mean to “deploy” an application?**
Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device. Software deployment refers to the process of making the application work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment or a user's computer or mobile device.

## **Term**

1. **A cloud server** is powerful physical or virtual infrastructure that performs application- and information-processing storage. Cloud servers are created using virtualization software to divide a physical (bare metal) server into multiple virtual servers.

2. **WRRC**  is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.
