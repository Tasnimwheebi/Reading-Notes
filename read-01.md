# Html struture 
HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

**Attributes** tell us
more about elements :they provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.
***
### The elements : Body, Head & Title
* Everything inside the body is
shown inside the main browser
window.
* The head element contains information
about the page.
* The title element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit.

### DOCTYPES
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using.
### COMMENT
If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:

 <  !-- comment goes here -- > 
 ## ATRIBUTES :

 ### ID ATTRIBUTE
 Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page eample : id = "----"

The id attribute is known as a
global attribute because it can
be used on any element.
### CLASS ATRIBUTES
Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute. 
It is the way to identify different elements.

### ELEMENTS
Some elements are blocked, the other are inline :
* Blocked elements will appear to start on a new line in the browser window.

Examples :
< h1 >, < p >, < ul >, and < li >.
* Inline element  will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements.

Examples 
< a >, < b >, < em >, and < img >.

## WE CAN GROUP A TEXT AND ELEMENTS IN A BLOCK BY:
* < div > :  
The < div > element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
* < span >
The < span > element acts like
an inline equivalent of the < div >
element.

## Iframe 
An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page â€” and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.
## SCROLING 
I it indicates
whether the iframe should
have scrollbars or not.
